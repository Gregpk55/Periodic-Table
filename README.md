# Periodic Table React App

## Overview

This project is a dynamic and interactive representation of the Periodic Table of Elements built with React. It leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to present a user-friendly interface displaying detailed information on each element. The project utilizes element data from a JSON file available on GitHub and is inspired by a CSS-based periodic table example.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Click on an element to view detailed information including atomic number, symbol, name, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: The periodic table is designed to be responsive and looks good on devices of all sizes.
